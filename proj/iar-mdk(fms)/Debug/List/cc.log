Creating copy init batch C1 (Table) for P1 -> P4, auto
  First match: .data (AppCore.o #8)
Selecting packing algorithm for 'auto' batches
  Estimating size for copy init batch C1 (P1 -> P4):
      copy: 328 bytes
      packbits: 175 bytes
      lz77: 115 bytes
    Selecting lz77
  Using "copy" instead of "lz77" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 615 to 372
  Using "packbits" instead of "copy" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 372 to 333
