Creating copy init batch C1 (Table) for P1 -> P4, auto
  First match: .data (AppCore.o #8)
Selecting packing algorithm for 'auto' batches
  Estimating size for copy init batch C1 (P1 -> P4):
      copy: 456 bytes
      packbits: 323 bytes
      lz77: 160 bytes
    Selecting lz77
  Using "copy" instead of "lz77" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 660 to 500
  Using "packbits" instead of "copy" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 500 to 481
