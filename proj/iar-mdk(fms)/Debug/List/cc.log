Creating copy init batch C1 (Table) for P1 -> P4, auto
  First match: .data (AppCore.o #8)
Selecting packing algorithm for 'auto' batches
  Estimating size for copy init batch C1 (P1 -> P4):
      copy: 464 bytes
      packbits: 311 bytes
      lz77: 200 bytes
    Selecting lz77
  Using "copy" instead of "lz77" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 700 to 508
  Using "packbits" instead of "copy" everywhere reduces total estimated
    overhead from 508 to 469
